Okay, oh wow. Just walked out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Drop and man—where do I even start? Theater was louder than a rock concert with people rustling like blustery autumn leaves in seats. I still feel the sticky remnants of buttery popcorn on my fingers, and my back—cripes, like an old man who fell asleep on a teetering stack of ancient philosophers' dusty works. Anyway, this  ... an undulating river of chaos.

It's like someone threw Fraggle Rock and Inception into a cosmic blender. There was this one scene, I swear, where it felt like the characters were speaking directly to the person behind me. Distracting but kind of mystical? I mean, their dialogue was as cryptic as a crossword puzzle in another language while my back was screaming louder than the speakers. And they just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   into your brain, okay maybe not literally but I swear it felt like it. 

> Oh! And the lighting. Don’t even get me started on the lighting—it was softer than a well-worn paperback, yet sharper than an unexpected freshman philosophy question hurled at a half-asleep class. The 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮’s intention was to blend unreality with reality and yet the people beside me, crunching popcorn too loudly—they made reality inescapable. Somehow the more distracted I was, the more engrossed I got. 

I think I almost lost track of what was happening—a cavalcade of images tumbling into each other like autumn leaves caught in a dizzying whirl. Or was it coffee cups? Somewhere amid this noisy chaos was a brick of narrative about a drop—of what? Water? Consciousness? The suspense was thick like oatmeal left too long in the pot, stubbornly clinging to your thoughts. The protagonist could've been anyone in the crowd, like the barista at the morning cafe—one of us disguised under layers of neons and fog. 

You should really 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   with headphones or something. If the theater had a mind, it was definitely in disarray—caught between its appreciation for the visual and its obsession with sonic overdrive, just at the point where my mind melted slightly into the plush folding chair. 

Just remember, the  ’s available if you want to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  . Though, in contemplating the fabric of reality woven by this Drop, am I expressing enough how stupefying it was?
